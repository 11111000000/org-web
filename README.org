* org-web - org mode on the web
org-web lets you directly edit your org files online. It syncs with Dropbox and is optimized for mobile use.

It was born out of my desire to be able to easily view and edit my org files from my phone. You can see it in action [[https://org-web.org][here]].

If you don't already keep your org files in Dropbox, I recommend symlinking them in:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ln -s ~/Documents/todo.org ~/Dropbox/todo.org
#+END_SRC
** Development
org-web is built with React and Redux, because, ya know, its 2017.

It was bootstrapped with the wonderful [[https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app][Create React App]], but I have since ejected.

To get started, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC
yarn install
yarnpkg start
#+END_SRC

To test against your actual Dropbox, you'll need to create a ~.env~ file with org-web's client ID:

#+BEGIN_SRC
REACT_APP_DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID=u857m8dfqth1ofi
#+END_SRC

Note that this will only work if you're running the app on ~http://localhost:3000~.

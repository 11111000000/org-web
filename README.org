* org-web - org mode on the web, optimized for mobile
org-web lets you directly edit your org files online. It syncs with Dropbox and is optimized for mobile use.

It was born out of my desire to be able to easily view and edit my org files from my phone. You can see it in action [[https://org-web.org][here]].

If you don't already keep your org files in Dropbox, I recommend symlinking them in:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ln -s ~/Documents/todo.org ~/Dropbox/todo.org
#+END_SRC
